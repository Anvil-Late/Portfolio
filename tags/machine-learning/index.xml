      <description>In this article, I go through every step that is necessary to have a functioning pipeline :
 Create a Kuberneter cluster Install Kubeflow Create a container registry Build a container image and push it to your registry Give Kubeflow access to your S3 buckets Create Kubeflow components with input and output artifacts Create a Kubeflow pipeline, upload it and run it  This article has been pee-reviewed and published in &amp;ldquo;Towards Data Science&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Project 6 : Classifying Disasters on Social Media</title>

      <description>This project is my take on the &amp;ldquo;Real or Not ? NLP with Disaster Tweets&amp;rdquo; Kaggle competition, in which we are provided a list of tweets that can either be about a disaster or not.
All of these tweets have been detected based on keywords such as &amp;ldquo;ablaze&amp;rdquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s up to the competitor to build a model that determines wheter these words were used in the context of an actual event.</description>

      <title>Project 5 : House Price Prediction</title>

      <description>In this project, my goal was to build a predictive model to answer the House Prices Kaggle Competition, in which we are provided with diverse data concerning houses such as quality, number of bathrooms, areas, in order to predict the final sale price.
The large majority of the work was spent on exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, with some data cleaning to do in both the training and test set.</description>

      <description>A machine learning project in which I used fitbit-like sensor data from gyroscopes and accelerometers to predict the performance of a weightlifting exercise.
This project goes through the following key steps :
