      <description>This project is my second take on the &amp;ldquo;Real or Not ? NLP with Disaster Tweets&amp;rdquo; Kaggle competition, in which we are provided a list of tweets that can either be about a disaster or not. You can find my first attempt here
Last time, I was a rather junior data scientist. I focused heavily on feature engineering and bags of words to put into machine learning model, and managed to obtain a decent score of 78% with ensemble models.</description>

      <description>This project is my take on the &amp;ldquo;Real or Not ? NLP with Disaster Tweets&amp;rdquo; Kaggle competition, in which we are provided a list of tweets that can either be about a disaster or not.
All of these tweets have been detected based on keywords such as &amp;ldquo;ablaze&amp;rdquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s up to the competitor to build a model that determines wheter these words were used in the context of an actual event.</description>
