      <title>Medium article - Basic Kubeflow Pipeline From Scratch</title>

      <description>In this article, I go through every step that is necessary to have a functioning pipeline :
 Create a Kuberneter cluster Install Kubeflow Create a container registry Build a container image and push it to your registry Give Kubeflow access to your S3 buckets Create Kubeflow components with input and output artifacts Create a Kubeflow pipeline, upload it and run it  This article has been pee-reviewed and published in &amp;ldquo;Towards Data Science&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>TDS article - Kubeflow MLOps : Automatic pipeline deployment with CI / CD / CT</title>

      <description>In this second Kubeflow articles, I build upon what was created in the first one and :
 Make an advanced pipeline that contains pre-processing, model building, inference and performance evaluation Use GitHub Actions to perform CI and CD Connect GitHub Actions to the Kubeflow endpoint and launch the updated pipeline  This article has been pee-reviewed and published in &amp;ldquo;Towards Data Science&amp;rdquo;. Kubeflow being new and its documentation being sparse for environments other than GCP made this article a rapid success, with more than 2000 reads in the first 2 days.</description>

      <description>This is an article I posted on Medium that deals with anomaly detection for scoring models&amp;rsquo; outputs.

      <title>Project 8 : Deep Learning Classification on Social Media</title>

      <description>This project is my second take on the &amp;ldquo;Real or Not ? NLP with Disaster Tweets&amp;rdquo; Kaggle competition, in which we are provided a list of tweets that can either be about a disaster or not. You can find my first attempt here
Last time, I was rather new to data science. I focused heavily on feature engineering and bags of words to put into machine learning models and managed to obtain a decent score of 78% with ensemble models.</description>

      <title>Project 7 : NLP and Image processing - Automatic classification of website products (Deep Learning and Clustering)</title>
      <link>https://Anvil-Late.github.io/Portfolio/post/project-7/</link>

      <description>This project&amp;rsquo;s goal is to build a model that can classify consumer goods based on pictures and descriptions.
I approached this project with basic and advanced methods for both NLP and image recognition.
For basic methods, I used feature extractions and clustering, whereas for advanced methods I used supervised neural networks.
Moreover, the dataset we were provided with was small, which made it necessary to either use dimension reduction for clustering algorithms or transfer learning for neural networks.</description>

      <title>Project 6 : Classifying Disasters on Social Media</title>

      <description>This project is my take on the &amp;ldquo;Real or Not ? NLP with Disaster Tweets&amp;rdquo; Kaggle competition, in which we are provided a list of tweets that can either be about a disaster or not.
All of these tweets have been detected based on keywords such as &amp;ldquo;ablaze&amp;rdquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s up to the competitor to build a model that determines wheter these words were used in the context of an actual event.</description>

      <title>Project 5 : House Price Prediction</title>
      <link>https://Anvil-Late.github.io/Portfolio/post/project-5/</link>

      <guid>https://Anvil-Late.github.io/Portfolio/post/project-5/</guid>
      <description>In this project, my goal was to build a predictive model to answer the House Prices Kaggle Competition, in which we are provided with diverse data concerning houses such as quality, number of bathrooms, areas, in order to predict the final sale price.
The large majority of the work was spent on exploratory data analysis and feature engineering, with some data cleaning to do in both the training and test set.</description>

      <title>Project 4 : Next Word Predictor</title>
      <link>https://Anvil-Late.github.io/Portfolio/post/project-4/</link>

      <guid>https://Anvil-Late.github.io/Portfolio/post/project-4/</guid>
      <description>In this project, my goal was to familiarize myself with natural language processing and use it to build a &amp;ldquo;next word&amp;rdquo; predictive model such as the ones we have on our smartphones keyboards. For that, I used a database provided by SwiftKey.
I divided this project into three parts : the App (hosted on ShinyApps), the project pitch (hosted on RPubs), and the GitHub repository that contains the App&amp;rsquo;s code.</description>

      <guid>https://Anvil-Late.github.io/Portfolio/post/project-3/</guid>
      <description>A machine learning project in which I used fitbit-like sensor data from gyroscopes and accelerometers to predict the performance of a weightlifting exercise.
This project goes through the following key steps :
 Raw Data gathering and cleaning Model building - RandomForest Cross validation and Testing  Link to the GitHub repository</description>

      <description>This is a quick project I made to familiarize myself with building shiny apps, especially :
 Using background plots to display on the UI Having reactive variables displayed on the plot Handling null inputs and error outputs on the UI display  I used ggplot to create the background graphs.

      <description>Here, I built two interactive maps to familiarize myself with the leaflet and plotly packages to make data products and presentations :
